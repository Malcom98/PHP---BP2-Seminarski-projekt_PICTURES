Front end: HTML, BOOTSTRAP, JS 
Back end: PHP with PDO

This project was made for college purposes.
New things that I've tried here are Bootstrap CSS framework and PHP PDO connection.
Project has basic CRUD operations with PDO database connection.
Project also has ERA model, triggers and complex queries.
